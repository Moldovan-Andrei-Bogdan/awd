                    <h2>The Meaning of Collaboration</h2>
                    <p>Collaboration stems from the Latin <em>com-</em> meaning "with" or "together," and <em>laborare</em> meaning "to work." First appearing in English around the 1850s, the word fundamentally describes the act of working jointly with others toward a shared goal.</p>
                    <p>At its core, collaboration represents more than simple cooperation—it embodies the process of combining diverse skills, knowledge, and perspectives to create something greater than any individual could achieve alone. It's about shared creation, mutual learning, and collective problem-solving.</p>

                    <p>Understanding collaboration deepens with personal experience. Early encounters might feel awkward or challenging—learning to compromise, share credit, and navigate different working styles. Over time, patterns emerge:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Initial phase:</strong> Learning to communicate clearly and establish shared goals</li>
                        <li><strong>Development:</strong> Building trust, recognizing each person's strengths, and finding rhythm as a team</li>
                        <li><strong>Maturity:</strong> Seamless coordination, anticipating needs, and creating together with minimal friction</li>
                        <li><strong>Reflection:</strong> Appreciating how collaboration shapes both the work and the people involved</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Each collaborative experience teaches something new about working with others—patience, flexibility, the power of diverse thinking, or simply that together we can achieve what none of us could alone.</p>
